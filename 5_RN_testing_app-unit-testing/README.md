# Project Testing Guide

This `README.md` provides guidelines on Unit Testing, End-to-End (E2E) Testing, and the testing methodologies used in our project, specifically White-Box and Gray-Box testing.

## What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions in isolation to verify that they perform as expected. This is the first line of defense in ensuring code quality.

### White-Box Testing in Unit Tests

**White-box testing** focuses on testing the internal structure, design, and implementation of the code. The tester knows the internal workings of the application and tests all possible paths, conditions, and loops.

#### Example Unit Test

```javascript
import { add } from './math';

describe('add function', () => {
  it('should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
    expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
  });

  it('should return a negative number when subtracting a larger number', () => {
    expect(add(3, -5)).toBe(-2);
  });
});
```

### Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will execute all unit tests and provide a summary of the results.

## What is End-to-End (E2E) Testing?

E2E testing simulates real user scenarios by testing the entire application flow from start to finish. This ensures that all integrated components work together correctly.

### Gray-Box Testing in E2E Tests

**Gray-box testing** combines elements of both white-box and black-box testing. The tester has partial knowledge of the internal structure of the application and uses this knowledge to create tests that verify both the user interface and the underlying processes.

#### Example E2E Test

```javascript
describe('User Registration', () => {
  it('should allow a user to register', async () => {
    await device.reloadReactNative();
    
    await element(by.id('registerButton')).tap();
    await element(by.id('emailInput')).typeText('test@example.com');
    await element(by.id('passwordInput')).typeText('password123');
    await element(by.id('submitButton')).tap();

    await expect(element(by.text('Registration Successful'))).toBeVisible();
    
    // Check if the user data was correctly saved in the database (gray-box aspect)
    const user = await getUserFromDatabase('test@example.com');
    expect(user).not.toBeNull();
  });
});
```

### Running E2E Tests

To run E2E tests, ensure your testing environment (e.g., emulator/simulator) is set up, and then use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

This will execute all E2E tests and provide a summary of the results.

## Testing Best Practices

- **Isolate Tests**: Ensure unit tests do not depend on external services or state. Mock dependencies as needed.
- **Test Coverage**: Focus on quality over quantity. Ensure critical paths are well-tested.
- **Keep Tests Fast**: Unit tests should be quick to run. Optimize or move slow tests to E2E.
- **Continuous Integration**: Integrate tests into your CI/CD pipeline to maintain code quality across all environments.

## Conclusion

By combining Unit Testing (white-box) and E2E Testing (gray-box), we ensure our application is robust, reliable, and user-friendly. Regular testing helps catch bugs early, reduces regression, and improves overall software quality.

Happy testing!
