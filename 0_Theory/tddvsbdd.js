/**
 * Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) are both methodologies that emphasize the importance of testing but have different approaches and focuses.
 *
 * Test-Driven Development (TDD)
 * - **Focus**: TDD centers around writing tests before developing the actual code. The main goal is to ensure code correctness from a developer’s perspective.
 * - **Process**:
 *   - **Write a Test**: Start by writing a test for a specific piece of functionality.
 *   - **Run the Test**: Execute the test; it will initially fail because the functionality is not yet implemented.
 *   - **Write the Code**: Implement the minimal code needed to pass the test.
 *   - **Refactor**: Improve and clean up the code while keeping all tests passing.
 *   - **Repeat**: Continue this cycle (Red-Green-Refactor) for each new feature.
 * - **Test Level**: TDD focuses primarily on unit tests, which test individual components or functions in isolation.
 * - **Language**: Tests are typically written in the same programming language as the application code.
 * - **Examples**:
 *   - Writing a test to verify the correctness of a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.
 *   - Ensuring a method in a class behaves correctly under various conditions.
 *
 * Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
 * - **Focus**: BDD extends TDD by focusing on the behavior of the application from the user's perspective, fostering collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.
 * - **Process**:
 *   - **Define User Stories**: Capture requirements as user stories describing desired behavior from an end-user’s perspective.
 *   - **Write Scenarios**: Each user story includes scenarios written in a structured format (Given-When-Then) to describe different contexts of behavior.
 *   - **Automate Scenarios**: Automate these scenarios as tests using BDD frameworks.
 * - **Test Level**: BDD covers both unit tests and higher-level tests such as integration and acceptance tests, ensuring the software behaves correctly in real-world scenarios.
 * - **Language**: BDD encourages writing tests in natural language (using tools like Cucumber or SpecFlow) to make them accessible to non-technical stakeholders.
 * - **Examples**:
 *   - Writing a scenario for a login feature that details behavior when a user enters valid credentials.
 *   - Ensuring that a shopping cart feature operates correctly when items are added or removed.
