/**
 * User Scenario
 * As a user, I want to log in to the application so that I can access my account.
 *
 * Write a scenario for a successful login:
 * Scenario: Successful login
 * - **Given** the user is on the login page
 *   - This step sets up the initial state by navigating the user to the login page.
 * - **When** the user enters valid credentials
 *   - This step simulates the action of entering correct login information (username and password).
 * - **Then** the user should be redirected to the dashboard
 *   - This step checks that after entering valid credentials, the user is redirected to the dashboard.
 *
 * Cucumber Code Below
 * Cucumber uses the Gherkin language to write scenarios in a natural language format. Below is the Cucumber code that corresponds to the scenario described:
 */
Given("the user is on the login page", () => {
  // Navigate to login page
  // Implement code to direct the browser to the login page of the application
});

When("the user enters valid credentials", () => {
  // Enter username and password
  // Implement code to fill in the username and password fields with valid data
});

Then("the user should be redirected to the dashboard", () => {
  // Check redirection to dashboard
  // Implement code to verify that the user is successfully redirected to the dashboard after login
});
